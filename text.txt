With a decade of experience in IT Infrastructure, I have expertise in Linux and Windows servers, monitoring with Zabbix, virtualization with VMWare, and backup with Veeam.

My personal programming projects focus on Python and Flask, using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind for web development, published on the Railway platform and managed on GitHub. I have skills with essential Python libraries and web automation, and experience in Python integration with other tools.

Although my programming experience is based on personal projects, it has prepared me to contribute to larger scale projects.
